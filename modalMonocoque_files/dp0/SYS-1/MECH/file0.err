 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.078   TIME= 17:21:01
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.156   TIME= 17:21:01
 MPC184 elements are being used in the current analysis and the          
 NLGEOM,ON command has not been used.  Thus, only linearized behavior    
 will be considered.  If finite rotation and large deflection effects    
 are to be considered, please use the NLGEOM,ON command.                 

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.234   TIME= 17:21:01
 Material number 19 (used by element 5396) should normally have at least 
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.                                          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.656   TIME= 17:21:03
 Pivoting has been activated for the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver .  
 The memory required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that   
 event, use the DSPOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or       
 memory size used by the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver.
